          My name is <b>Emmanuel Oyelakin.</b>I love <em>Technology</em> because
          it is the triumph of the human intellect. The more I study and
          understand <i>technology</i>, the more I feel that nothing in the
          universe is out of reach. I love technology because I believe in
          progress. My aim in life is to use technology to improve lives and
          help others. Also technology opens up educational opportunities to the
          masses, in form of blog posts, forums. e-books,open online courses
          etc. Furthermore I can stay connected with friends and family even
          with the obvious barrier of location.

          In the past few weeks of my journey with Stutern, I have been taught
          in-depth on <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> and what they entail.
          <b>HTML</b>(Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup
          language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. This
          is basically the foundation and structure of a webpage.
          <b>CSS</b>(Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe
          <i>styles</i>(as the name implies) for presenting documents written in
          a markup language <em>i.e HTML, or XML</em>. I learnt how
          <i>box model</i> works, with the parameters governing a box model. I
          was also taught CSS inheritance, <b>Specificity Hierarchy</b>, CSS
          selectors, types and properties.

          <b>Padding:</b> This is the space between the element's border and the
          related content inside it. It determines how elements look and sit
          within a container. Simply put, <i>padding</i> property controls the
          space inside an element.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Margin:</b> This is the space around an element's border.
          <i>Margin</i> property controls the space outside an element.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Border:</b> The CSS <i>border</i> property allows you to specify
          the style, width, and color of an element's border.
